"""
Grid display.  

Displays a rectangular grid of cells, organized in rows and columns
with row 0 at the top and growing down, column 0 at the left and 
growing to the right.

Uses the simple graphics module provided by Zelle, which in turn 
is built on the Tk graphics package (and which should therefore be 
available on all major Python platforms, including Linux, Mac, and 
all flavors of Windows at least back to XP).  Requires Python 3.6 
or greater due to use of type annotations and module 'typing'.
